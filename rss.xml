            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Now Recruiting Team / Partners for Expanding Consulting Operation</h1><p>Current Project: Redesigning and revamping entire curriculum and strategy for 600 office STEM-based, independent educational organization.

Put simply, I am diving deep into personal experience with music, theater, speech, communication, teaching and theoretical studies in order to produce a huge range of activities that solve real problems. All one would have to do, when this is complete, is to identify a problem in communication, identifying skills, personality conflict, work flow or motivation and then follow the activity designed to combat this. Theory meets practicality!
