# Benefits

* Global Challenge is a game-based project for social studies that empowers students to learn more than just the class content. 
* Turns all your class content into an interactive game! 
* Great for reviews and test preparation.
* Learn real world skills like money management. 
* Students will find their areas of greatest strength and ability. 
* Students get to experience historical decision-making, rather than just read about it. 
* You and your students choose any app, program or platform, rather than have it decided for you!
* You can incorporate Evernote, Google Docs, Excel or your favorite platform. Play the game and have your students decide which app will help with each activity!
* Have your students use social networks to build friendships, alliances and generate team spirit!
* It's the 21st Century. Why have pre-determined apps, platforms and programs when your students should be figuring out how to find and use these tools for themselves. It's project based learning. Have your students build systems from the bottom up.
