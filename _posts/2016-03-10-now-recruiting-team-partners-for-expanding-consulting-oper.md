**Current Project: **Redesigning and revamping entire curriculum and strategy for 600 office STEM-based, independent educational organization. The idea that is emerging out of this could help ANY organization, office, classroom, school or company on a global scale. Put simply, I am diving deep into personal experience with music, theater, speech, communication, teaching and theoretical studies in order to produce a huge range of activities that solve real problems. All one would have to do, when this is complete, is to identify a problem in communication, identifying skills, personality conflict, work flow or motivation and then follow the activity designed to combat this. Theory meets practicality! The "thematic activity grid" draws on new information and designs from such areas as holacracy, multipotentiality, multiple intelligences, gamification and curiosity-based learning. 

This is all part of an ecosystem of products and ideas I've been working on with others -- many falling under the theme of self-organizing systems, user-generated design, holacracy, multi-potentialism as well as game and project-based design. 

# The Plan

Now that I'm seeing the potential with this and other contracts, I want to build a team of intelligent, creative people who can help bring this and other exciting, creative products to a global audience. I'm currently in search of talented people either with administrative, business management, marketing, writing and / or graphic arts abilities. Pay and or equity to be awarded as work comes in. 

You can view some work samples [here: ][0]

# Background

**The greatest potential for growth and creativity exists in an area called the "space between."**

The _Space Between_ refers to that area between all predefined, categorized, hard objects and / or visible things. It is the connective tissue, dark matter, string or ether that makes up the majority of all things in the universe, but is least understood. It is more practically the area between all our projects and things that connects us together.  It can be bended, twisted and formed into the types of things, systems and constructs that will propel individuals and society out of our state of unfulfilled potential and towards a more egalitarian, just, thriving, productive, creative and fulfilling world. 

# Themes

****

* User-generated, Self Organizing Systems
* Fixing broken systems and replacing them with more holacratic, emergent, self-perpetuating, positively structured models
* Gamification and new localized economies
* The application of knowledge and creativity to real-world, unpredictable situations
* Capturing ideas while in action / motion and preserving them on audio and video for active use
* Harnessing the power of the "space between" by forming connections or threads between usually disconnected things
* Using the power of emotion from sources such as humor, music, ideas and people to propel productivity and social change
