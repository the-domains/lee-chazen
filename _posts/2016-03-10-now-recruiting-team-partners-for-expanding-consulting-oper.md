# Now Recruiting Team / Partners for Expanding Consulting Operation

Theory meets practicality! No more applying one theory or idea to solve any type of work or organizational problem. Now, there's a way to get really creative in problem solving. 

I am diving deep into personal experience with music, theater, speech, communication, teaching and theoretical studies in order to produce a **huge range of activities** that solve real problems. All one would have to do when this is complete is to identify a problem in communication, application of skills, personality conflict, work flow or motivation and then follow the activity designed to help in this area. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9baa7bdf01acfcb630949c40695bfd68ba31a20e.png)

The **"thematic activity grid" **which I'm building draws on new information and designs from such areas as holacracy, multipotentiality, multiple intelligences, gamification and curiosity-based learning. 

This is all part of an ecosystem of products and ideas I've been working on with others -- many falling under the theme of self-organizing systems, user-generated design, holacracy, multi-potentialism as well as game and project-based design. 

**Areas of work include: **Organizational Design, Curriculum and Content Development, Project and Game-Based Learning, Education Technology, etc. 

**Current Project **involves redesigning and revamping entire curriculum and strategy for 600 office STEM-based, private educational organization. The ideas and themes that are emerging out of this could help ANY organization, office, classroom, school or company on a global scale. 

# The Plan

Now that I'm seeing the potential with this and other contracts, I want to build a team of intelligent, creative people who can help bring this and other exciting, creative products to a global audience. I'm currently in search of either an agent or group of talented people with skills in administration, business management, marketing, writing and / or graphic arts. Pay and or equity to be awarded as work comes in.

# Background

**The greatest potential for growth and creativity exists in an area called the "space between."**

The _Space Between_ refers to that area between all predefined, categorized, "hard" objects and / or visible things. It is the connective tissue, dark matter, string or ether that makes up the majority of all things in the universe, but is least understood. It is more practically the area between all our projects and things that connect us together.  It can be bended, twisted and formed into the types of things, systems and constructs that will propel individuals and society out of our state of unfulfilled potential and towards a more egalitarian, just, thriving, productive, creative and fulfilling world. 

# Themes

* User-generated, Self Organizing Systems
* Fixing broken systems and replacing them with more holacratic, emergent, self-perpetuating, positively structured models
* Gamification and new localized economies
* The application of knowledge and creativity to real-world, unpredictable situations
* Capturing ideas while in action / motion and preserving them on audio and video for active use
* Harnessing the power of the "space between" by forming connections or threads between usually disconnected things
* Using the power of emotion from sources such as humor, music, ideas and people to propel productivity and social change
